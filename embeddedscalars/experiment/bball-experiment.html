<p class="block-text blurb">We are trying to train an automated sportscasting system to generate color commentary on simple competitions. We'd like you to make judgments about the quality of the comments it generates. We'll use these ratings to train our system further.</p>

<p class="block-text blurb">On each page, we will show you the outcome from a basketball free-throw shooting competition between 3 players, labeled A B and C for convenience. We'll give you a comment the system has generated, and your job is to rate how good the comment is. If no one would ever say a particular comment, or if it's just wrong, rank that as "bad"; but if something is right and sounds perfectly normal, mark it as "good." Try to use the whole scale to make your ratings.</p>
