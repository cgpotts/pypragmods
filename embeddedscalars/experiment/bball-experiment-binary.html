<p class="block-text blurb">We are trying to train an automated sportscasting system to generate color commentary on simple competitions. We'd like you to make judgments about the comments it generates. We'll use these ratings to train our system further.</p>

<p class="block-text blurb">On each page, we will show you the outcome from a basketball free-throw shooting competition between 3 players, labeled A B and C for convenience. We'll give you a comment the system has generated, and your job is to decide whether a comment is true or false.</p>
